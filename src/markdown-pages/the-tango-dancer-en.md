I started to dance tango - Argentinian tango - just before i turned fifty. I knew imideately that this was "home" for me. I was exactly where I wanted to be. Argentinian tango is an improvised dance for couples with no fix pattern or sequences. As a beginner you learn some steps and sequences. After a while you become a social dancer. Then you stop thinking about steps and sequences and start to create you own personal dance together with your partner. When I started to dance and was in dispair, my friend Joe who is an experienced tango dancer told me: "Remember the simplest tango is an embrace - Just dance the way you play blues .... Simple". Every new dance is a new creation. For me, it's about passion, joy, lust, focus, creativity, connection, curiosity, oportunity, sexuality - to be in the presence. Tango takes me to places my body and soul are longing for - places, I can't visit outside my tango world.
